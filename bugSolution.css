To fix this, we can adjust the specificity of the selectors. We might increase the specificity of the general selector or decrease the specificity of the more specific selector.  One method is to use the !important flag but this isn't considered good practice. Another solution is to restructure the CSS to use more appropriate class names or IDs, or even re-arrange the order in which the styles are defined to ensure the proper specificity precedence. Consider better organization using more specific class names.
